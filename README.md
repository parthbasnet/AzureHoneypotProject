## Introduction

In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving cloud environments, organizations face persistent challenges in detecting and mitigating cyber threats. This project addresses these challenges by simulating a real-world scenario where a vulnerable cloud infrastructure is monitored, hardened, and analyzed to enhance security defenses.

I constructed a mini honeynet in Microsoft Azure to mimic an organization's network, ingesting logs from various Azure resources into a centralized Log Analytics Workspace. These logs were analyzed using Microsoft Sentinel to build attack maps, trigger alerts, and generate incidents.

The purpose of this project was to measure the effectiveness of security controls in mitigating threats. To achieve this, I gathered baseline security metrics from the insecure environment over 24 hours, implemented robust security controls to harden the environment, and collected metrics for another 24 hours to assess the impact.

This approach demonstrates how organizations can leverage cloud-native tools to detect, respond to, and prevent sophisticated attacks while building a data-driven strategy to continuously improve their security posture.

The Metrics collected are:
- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into our honeynet)

The architecture of the honeynet in Azure consists of the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel

The following table shows the metrics I measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
<br>
| Start Time 2024-12-27 12:34:48
<br>
| Stop Time 2024-12-28 12:34:48

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 7671
| Syslog                   | 833
| SecurityAlert            | 4
| SecurityIncident         | 59
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 620

## Attack Maps After Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```


## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but with security controls:

| Start Time 2024-12-29 10:45:28
<br>
| Stop Time 2024-12-30 10:45:28

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 3894
| Syslog                   | 6

## Summary

This project involved constructing a mini honeynet within Microsoft Azure, designed to capture and analyze security events. Logs from various Azure resources were ingested into a Log Analytics Workspace and monitored using Microsoft Sentinel, which was configured to trigger alerts and generate incidents based on detected anomalies. Metrics were gathered from the environment during a 24-hour period of intentional vulnerability, followed by another 24-hour period after implementing security controls.

The results demonstrated a significant reduction in security events and incidents after the application of these controls, highlighting their effectiveness in mitigating potential threats. It is worth noting that if the network had been subject to typical user activity, the number of generated security events and alerts could have been higher during the post-hardening phase.
